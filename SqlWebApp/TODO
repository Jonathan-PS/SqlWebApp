CREATE AND INIT DB
- Fix LocalDate to Date to db
- Move the filling of the tables

CRUD to db
- Done with INSERT (Create)
- need SELECT (read)
- Need UPDATE with rollback on fail
- Need DELETE

Temporary Java Objects
- Store info in POJO --> class Person{}
- So create 4 classes
(When SELECTing more than one sql element, store in ArrayList)


REST
- Take any POJO and send to browser
